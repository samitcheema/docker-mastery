# Assignment: Writing a Dockerfile

> This dir contains a Node.js app, you need to get it running in a container
> No modifications to the app should be necessary, only edit this Dockerfile

> Overview of this assignment

- use the instructions from developer below to create a working Dockerfile
- feel free to add command inline below or use a new file, up to you (but must be named Dockerfile)
- once Dockerfile builds correctly, start container locally to make sure it works on http://localhost
- then ensure image is named properly for your Docker Hub account with a new repo name
- push to Docker Hub, then go to https://hub.docker.com and verify
- then remove local image from cache
- then start a new container from your Hub image, and watch how it auto downloads and runs
- test again that it works at http://localhost
